# Overview
Welcome to Diabetes Deep Dive! This repository offers a comprehensive analysis of diabetes data, incorporating data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and a range of advanced modeling techniques. The project includes regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning to uncover insights and predict diabetes outcomes effectively.

# Project Components
## Data Cleaning:

Thorough cleaning of the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Transformation and normalization of features to ensure data quality.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Initial exploration to understand the datasetâ€™s structure and key characteristics.
Summary statistics and pattern discovery to guide further analysis.

## Visualization:

Creation of various plots and charts to represent data distributions, relationships, and trends.
Includes heatmaps, histograms, scatter plots, and more for intuitive data exploration.

## Data Preparation:

Feature engineering and encoding to prepare data for modeling.
Normalization and scaling techniques to enhance model performance.

## Modeling:

### Regression: Techniques to model and predict continuous variables related to diabetes.
### Classification: Methods to classify data points into categories such as disease presence or absence.
### Clustering: Unsupervised learning to find natural groupings within the data.

## Results and Evaluation:
Evaluation of model performance using various metrics.

Analysis of results and insights to understand predictions and trends.
